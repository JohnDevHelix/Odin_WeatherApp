#Odin Project Weather Application

Created an app to check current weather condition based on the location provided. Will show location, current weather and different temperature. Can change temperature from Fahrenheit to Celcius vv. Weather icon and background will change based on current condition.

App was created using a public API and other things that I've learned so far. Usage of JS async and await, and catch method for error handling.
